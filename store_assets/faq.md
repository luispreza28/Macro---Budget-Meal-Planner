# Macro + Budget Meal Planner - Frequently Asked Questions

## üîß Getting Started

### Q: How accurate are the macro calculations?
**A:** Our macro calculations are highly accurate (¬±2%) for ingredients in our database. We use per-100g nutritional data and calculate exact portions. For user-added ingredients, accuracy depends on the data you provide.

### Q: Why do I need to set a budget?
**A:** Setting a budget is optional but recommended. It helps the app:
- Choose cost-effective ingredients
- Prioritize budget-friendly recipes
- Show you exactly what you'll spend
- Help you save money while hitting nutrition goals

### Q: Can I use the app without setting macro targets?
**A:** Macro targets are required for meal planning. If you're unsure of your targets:
- Use our built-in calculator based on your goals
- Start with general guidelines (1g protein per lb body weight)
- Consult a nutritionist for personalized targets
- Adjust targets after a few weeks of tracking

## üçΩÔ∏è Meal Planning

### Q: Why doesn't my plan hit my macros exactly?
**A:** The app aims for ¬±5% accuracy on calories and prioritizes protein targets. Perfect macro matching is mathematically difficult with real foods. Use the swap feature to fine-tune your daily balance.

**A:** Yes! Add custom recipes by:
1. Go to Recipes ‚Üí Add Custom
2. Enter ingredients and quantities
3. The app automatically calculates macros and cost

### Q: What if I don't like a suggested meal?
**A:** Use the smart swap feature:
1. Tap the meal you want to change
2. Select "Find Alternatives"

## üõí Shopping & Budgeting

### Q: Why are the shopping list quantities confusing?
**A:** The app shows both what you need for recipes AND realistic purchase sizes:
- "Need 300g rice (buy 1kg bag, 700g leftover)"
- This prevents you from trying to buy impossible quantities
- Leftovers can be used in future meal plans or pantry

### Q: Are the price estimates accurate?
**A:** Prices are estimates based on average grocery costs. They vary by:
- Geographic location
- Store type (discount vs premium)
- Brand choices (generic vs name brand)
- Seasonal availability

**Tip:** Edit prices in the shopping list to match your local store for better accuracy.

### Q: How can I save more money?
**A:** Try these strategies:
- Use Pantry-First planning (Pro feature)
- Choose Bulking (Budget) mode for cost-efficient calories
- Buy ingredients in bulk when possible
- Shop seasonal produce
- Update prices to reflect store brands
- Use the swap feature to find cheaper alternatives

## Using Smart Swaps

### Why Swap?
Sometimes you might want to change a meal because:
- You don't like a particular ingredient
- You want to save money
- You need more protein for the day
- You want something quicker to prepare

### How to Swap
1. Tap on any meal in your plan
2. Select "Find Alternatives"
3. Browse suggested swaps with impact preview
4. Tap a swap to see the exact changes it will make
5. Confirm the swap to update your plan

### Understanding Swap Impact
Each swap shows:
- **Cost Impact**: "Save $3/week" or "Costs $2 more/week"
- **Macro Impact**: "+12g protein/day" or "-5g carbs/meal"
- **Time Impact**: "5 minutes faster" or "10 minutes longer"
- **Reason**: "Uses pantry rice" or "Higher protein option"

### Smart Swap Algorithm
The app suggests swaps based on:
- Your current macro needs for the day
- Budget constraints
- Available pantry items (Pro)
- Dietary restrictions
- Prep time preferences
- Variety (avoids too much repetition)

## Managing Your Shopping List

### Auto-Generated Lists
Your shopping list is automatically created from your meal plan and includes:
- **All ingredients** needed for the week
- **Exact quantities** calculated from your meal servings
- **Pack rounding** (buy 1 lb bag instead of 0.3 lbs)
- **Aisle organization** for efficient shopping
- **Cost estimates** with running total

### Editing Your List
- **Adjust quantities**: Tap any item to modify the amount
- **Edit prices**: Update prices to match your local store
- **Check off items**: Mark items as purchased while shopping
- **Add custom items**: Include non-meal items like household goods

### Pack Rounding Explained
The app converts recipe quantities to realistic purchase sizes:
- Recipe needs 300g rice → Buy 1kg bag (700g leftover)
- Recipe needs 1.5 cans tomatoes → Buy 2 cans (0.5 can leftover)
- Leftovers are noted so you can plan future meals

### Export Options
**Free Users**: Export as text or Markdown
**Pro Users**: Additional CSV and PDF export options

- âœ… Complete database schema designed with 6 tables:
  - `Ingredients` - Nutritional and cost data
  - `Recipes` - Meal planning recipes
  - `UserTargets` - User preferences and macro goals
  - `PantryItems` - On-hand ingredients (Pro feature)
  - `Plans` - Generated meal plans
  - `PriceOverrides` - Custom ingredient pricing
- âœ… Code generation working successfully

### âœ… Routing (GoRouter)
- âœ… GoRouter 12.1.3 configured
- âœ… Declarative routing with deep linking support
- âœ… Navigation between main app screens established

### âœ… Material Design 3 Theme
- âœ… Modern Material Design 3 implementation
- âœ… Light and dark theme support
- âœ… Brand colors for health/nutrition focus
- âœ… Custom theme extensions for macro tracking colors

### âœ… Core App Pages (Placeholder Implementation)
- âœ… Onboarding page with welcome flow
- âœ… Home page with navigation to main features
- âœ… Plan page for meal planning (Stage 3 implementation)
- âœ… Shopping list page (Stage 3 implementation)
- âœ… Pantry page for Pro features (Stage 5 implementation)
- âœ… Settings page (Stage 4 implementation)

### âœ… Testing Infrastructure
- âœ… Unit test framework configured with mocktail
- âœ… Widget testing setup with proper Riverpod integration
- âœ… Basic tests for app constants and navigation
- âœ… All tests passing (9/9) âœ…
- âœ… Static analysis clean (0 issues) âœ…

### âœ… Code Generation & Build Tools
- âœ… Build runner configured for Drift database generation
- âœ… JSON serialization setup for future API integration
- âœ… Code generation working successfully

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Clean Architecture Foundation**: Established a maintainable, testable codebase following domain-driven design principles.

2. **Type-Safe Database**: Complete SQLite schema with Drift providing compile-time safety and automatic code generation.

3. **Modern UI Framework**: Material Design 3 with dynamic theming and accessibility considerations.

4. **Robust State Management**: Riverpod providing compile-safe dependency injection and reactive state management.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and widget tests with 100% pass rate and clean static analysis.

## Project Statistics
- **Files Created**: 20+ core files
- **Dependencies Configured**: 15+ production dependencies
- **Test Coverage**: Basic foundation tests implemented
- **Code Quality**: 0 analysis issues, all tests passing
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps (Stage 2)
The foundation is now ready for Stage 2: Core Data Layer implementation, which will include:
- Complete data models and entities
- Repository pattern implementation
- Seed data for ingredients and recipes
- Data validation and error handling
- Reactive data streams

## Files Modified/Created
### Core Files
- `lib/main.dart` - App entry point with Riverpod
- `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart` - Material Design 3 theme
- `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart` - App-wide constants
- `lib/core/errors/failures.dart` - Error handling framework

### Presentation Layer
- `lib/presentation/router/app_router.dart` - GoRouter configuration
- `lib/presentation/pages/*/` - All main app pages

### Data Layer
- `lib/data/datasources/database.dart` - Drift database schema

### Configuration
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and project configuration
- `analysis_options.yaml` - Code quality rules

### Tests
- `test/widget_test.dart` - Widget testing
- `test/unit/core/constants/app_constants_test.dart` - Unit tests

Stage 1 is complete and the app foundation is solid! ðŸŽ‰
